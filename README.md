# Pretrained Transformers Comparison

This is a comparison of 15 pretrained transformers models on the task of sentiment analysis for Google Play app reviews. 

A summary of our findings can be found at https://paul-tqh-nguyen.github.io/google_reviews_transformers_comparison/.

### Tools Used

The following tools were utilized:

- [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Pandarallel](https://github.com/nalepae/pandarallel)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

We used [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for the visualizations in our documentation.

Our implementation also uses Python [metaclasses](https://realpython.com/python-metaclasses/).

Other Python libraries used include [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html), [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html), [abc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html), [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html), [typing-extensions](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/), [contextlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html), [functools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html), [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html), [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html), [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html), [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html), [operator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html), and [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).
